autoDeleteFiles script

A Script to autoDelete files once a threshold (lowTide) of free space has been exceeded

The script will start with the oldest files and progressively delete newer files until the required free HDD space (highTide) is achieved

At each defined file age criterion, the script will delete the largest files first, check the HDD space, and repeat for smaller and smaller files until the HDD free space meets the % free space required

If the free HDD space is not met on the first age criterion, the script will move to the next age criterion and repeat

The script will work it's way through the age and size criteria until it either frees up enough HDD space (highTide), or it exhausts the criteria, then the script will end

A Logfile may be generated in the chosen location to report actions
