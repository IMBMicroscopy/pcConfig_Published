ppmsConfig script

The first part of this script allows admins to configure the script to get system and user details from PPMS server and save them to registry
The second part is used to configure how the logoffscript behaves
Generally once these settings are configured for a facility, they dont require further modification per system
you may make backups of different configurations you need for Confocals, regular microscopes, Analysis Servers etc, store them in a sub-folder and copy them into the ppmsConfig folder as required.

Descriptions of each parameter are contained in the ppmsConfig.ps1 script

The "settings" script is used to configure the system for the PPMS server, so will require editing when installing the script for equipment in a different facility
	By default you shouldnt need to edit any of the default script settings, but if you wish to, then right click on the "settings" file to open in powershell_ISE,
	Each setting is commented to explain its functionality
	Edit as required, then save and close the file
	Double click "runMe.vbs" to install the required "task scheduler" task, registry keys and powershell modules etc
	Click Yes to run the script as administrator
	Type A when prompted to apply the script to all users.
	The script will now connect to the ppms server and generate the system and user details then close automatically


To uninstall, Right click and open/run the uninstall script
