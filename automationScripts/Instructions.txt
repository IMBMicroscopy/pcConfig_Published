PPMS and Other Automation Scripts for VM and Microscope Deployment

Requires: Existing instrument in PPMS for full functionality
	For auto-installation of scripts, Actual PC name should match name in PPMS
	Alternatively, at installation, you will be asked to select the facility and instrument from a popup window, there is also a fallback setting in the ppmsConfig.ps1 	file to match the facility and instrument name in ppms

Download Instructions:
	Sign in to Github, and download the “pcConfig” code repository as a .zip file
	Rename the downloaded folder from “pcConfig-main” to “pcConfig”
	
Installation instructions:
	Log in to the Microscope PC or VM as a local administrator
	If this is a new PC/VM install, copy the downloaded “pcConfig” folder to a location such as “C:\ “ or “C:Windows\” (Preferred)
	
	Note:  On a new PC/VM with windows 10 or later you wont need to install .dotNet etc in the later steps, but if you're running Windows 7 you may need to manually first install the correct versions of:
	dotNet, WMF etc which are included in each scripts sub-folders listed below as required. 

	In each of the following steps, you may see a popup window to run as administrator, click Yes to install the components and the script will run
	You may also see a prompt in this window which you need to answer 'A' = Yes to All (necessary for correct operation of the scripts) or if this isnt available 'Y' = Yes

	To Install all of the scripts automatically:
		If this is a new facility install
			Edit the parameters in the "config.ps1" or "settings.ps1" file in each script sub-folder first
		Ensure there is a suitable desktop wallpaper file in the "2_wallpapers" sub-folder
		Double click the runMe_InstallAllScripts.vbs file
		Click Yes to run the script as adminstrator if required
		You may be asked to locate a suitable wallpaper image file (5k 16:9 .jpg or .jpeg) in the "2_wallpapers" sub-folder
		Close the window when the script ends

	Alternatively:
	Manually install or configure the scripts for a new facility before running the auto-installer:
		Configure the PC:
			Open the "1_pcConfig" folder
				Double click on "runMe.vbs" to configure the PC
				If asked, Click “R” for “Run Once”
				Click Yes to run the script as administrator
				Type Y when prompted.
				The script will now install the required powershell modules and components and configure the PC which may take a few minutes, these steps include:
					Disables Fast User Switching
					Disables Screensaver password
					Disables Lock screen
					Configures folder permissions
					Creates a c:\logs folder
					Creates a logoff icon on the desktop
				Note don’t touch the configurePC.ps1 file unless you know what you’re doing.

			Now Install the scheduled scripts such as ppmsConfig etc:
	
		Install the Scheduled Scripts:
			Open the "2_scheduledScripts" folder 
				Important: First, open "1_ppmsConfig" folder
					The "ppmsConfig.ps1" script is used to configure the system for the PPMS server, so will require editing when installing the script for equipment in a different facility
					By default you shouldnt need to edit any of the default script settings, but if you wish to, then right click on the "ppmsConfig.ps1" file to open in powershell_ISE,
					Each setting is commented to explain its functionality
					Edit as required, then save and close the file
					Double click "runMe.vbs" to install the required "task scheduler" task, registry keys and powershell modules etc
					Click Yes to run the script as administrator
					Type A when prompted to apply the script to all users.
					The script will now connect to the ppms server and generate the system and user details then close automatically

			Open the “2_wallpaper” folder
				Requires: A suitable wallpaper image (.jpg or .jpeg) in 5k 16:9 format located in the "2_wallpaper" sub-folder
					If a wallpaper image doesnt exist, create a new wallpaper (5k 16:9 format, .jpg or .jpeg) and place it in the "2_wallpaper" folder
				Double click "runMe.vbs" to install the wallpaper for all users task
				The script will auto-detect a wallpaper image that matches the computer name (in this or the wallpaper sub-folder), if one isnt found, then a file browser window will appear to enable you to manually select a suitable image.
				
			
			Repeat for all of the other scripts in their sub-folders, ie: "logoffScript, validateUser" etc.
				Most scripts will have a "config.ps1" or "settings.ps1" file for settings unique to that script, which can be edited as required
				If you're running Windows7 this is where you may need to install additional .dotNet and WMF modules etc as required.
				The scripts will close automatically when completed
	
	Logging:
		Each script will have logging settings that you may enable/disable in their "config.ps1" file
		By default the generated logfiles are saved to "c:\scriptLogs"

	Other Scripts:	
		Install any other required scripts in the “pcConfig” directory specific to that system

Logoff and login as a regular user to confirm the scripts are performing as expected

To Uninstall/Disable the scripts:
	Open Task Scheduler and find the Microscopy folder which contains the tasks for each script
	Disable/Delete the scripts as required
	User settings are stored in the registry and by default will be located in "CurrentUser\Software\Microscopy" and "LocalMachine\Software\Microscopy"
